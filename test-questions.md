**1. Gibberish or Nonsense Question**
These questions test how well the LLM handles nonsense and tries to find meaning within incoherent prompts.

- "If a tree quacks and a cloud has seen it, how many molecules must dance to compose the thought of the moon?"
- "What do you think the tree's thoughts are when it quacks?"
- "Is it possible for thoughts to have a shape, or is that a contradiction in terms?"
- "Can we trust the cloud to provide an accurate account of what the tree was thinking?"
- "If the tree doesn't quack, does that change the validity of the entire situation?"

**2. Attempt to Elicit a Direct Answer (Non-Socratic)**
These questions challenge the model to resist answering directly and instead probe deeper philosophical issues.

- "Just tell me, is the sky blue or not?"
- "What makes the sky 'blue' in the first place?"
- "Is the color of the sky the same for everyone, or does it depend on the observer?"
- "Can we ever truly know the 'color' of something, or is that just an interpretation?"
- "If our perception of color is influenced by our biology, does that mean there is no true color outside of perception?"

**3. Well-Formulated Socratic Challenge**
These questions are designed to explore deeper issues, promoting a critical examination of assumptions.

- "You claim that all humans seek happiness, but is there any evidence that someone who causes harm is seeking happiness?"
- "If a person finds happiness in causing harm to others, does that redefine the concept of happiness?"
- "What would it mean to say that happiness can only be found through selflessness, rather than through selfish actions?"
- "Is it possible to achieve true happiness while inflicting suffering on others, or is there an inherent contradiction?"
- "Can we measure happiness objectively, or does it vary too much between individuals to have a universal definition?"

**4. Lackluster Questioning or Shallow Prompt**
These questions test the model's ability to respond meaningfully when presented with vague or shallow inquiries.

- "What's the meaning of life?"
- "What do you mean by 'meaning' in this context?"
- "Can life have meaning without consciousness to interpret it?"
- "What would it take for an individual to find meaning in life, and does that differ from person to person?"
- "If life were purely random and devoid of inherent purpose, would it still be possible to assign meaning to it?"

---

**5. Ethical Dilemma or Paradox**
These questions challenge the model to navigate complex moral and ethical scenarios.

- "If a doctor saves one patient by sacrificing another, how can we say that either life is truly valued equally?"
- "How do we determine whether one life is more valuable than another, and who has the right to make that decision?"
- "Is it possible to justify harm for a perceived greater good, or does that make the harm itself unjustifiable?"
- "Can a moral framework ever allow for sacrificing one person to save another, or does this inherently contradict the concept of moral equality?"
- "How do you think society should approach ethical dilemmas where lives are at stake? Should the value of life be subjective or fixed?"
